# Core Functionality Plugin

This is a basic WordPress developer plugin that can contain your site's core functionality. The concept is to keep structural features of a site that are theme independent, such as custom post-types, taxonomies and short-codes out of the theme's code. This will ensure that a future theme change does not affect a site's core functionality.

This is boilerplate code. A few includes and a few examples. It can be modified as necessary.

* `general.php` -- for any general functions you would write

* `post-types.php` -- for registering custom post types

* `shortcodes.php` -- for writing custom shortcodes

* `taxonomies.php` -- for custom taxonomies
