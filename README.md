# Core Functionality Plugin

This is a WordPress plugin that contains UCSC Main WordPress site's core functionality. The concept is to keep structural features of a site that are theme independent, such as custom post-types, taxonomies and roles out of the theme's code. This will ensure that a future theme change does not affect a site's core functionality.

This plugin is a work in progress, so far it includes

* `roles.php` -- for additional user roles beyond WordPress core
